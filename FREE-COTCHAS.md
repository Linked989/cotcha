Hey Ya! Quick update about the Cotchas. I have been working diligently on these, putting in at least 1hr a day on them, and they are coming along nicely. Yesterday’s hour was on software (fingers needed a soldering break).

*IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT* Unfortunately I cannot attend September’s SecKC, so I have decided to artificially restrict distribution.  So, at September’s SecKC, there will only be a *TOTAL of 23* cotchas released, @seckcory has volunteered to distribute the limited run cotchas.

Want to ensure you go home w/one?  They will be released in this order:
*1)* People who have submitted pull requests to the Cotcha Github (https://github.com/hevnsnt/SecKCESP8266)
*2)* People who do dope shit for SecKC, and/or make it happen. Not ready to contribute code?  Contribute your time to SecKC, join #secops for ideas on how to help.
*3)* People who have a demonstrated history of Arduino / Webdevelopment skills. I showed you my github, now you show me yours.

The best way to ENSURE you get one in September is to contribute to the code base. I will be bringing the other 77 cotchas in October. I will probably do something cheezy then too.  (beware)
